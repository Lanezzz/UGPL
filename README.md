# Train/Test
## Test
1.Modify the paths for the testing dataset and pre-trained model.  
2.python test_fuse.py

## Train
1.Select a certain number of ground truth, and modify the training dataset and pre-trained model paths to train the pseudo-label generator.  
python train.py  

2.Select a certain number of pseudo-labels, and modify the training dataset and pre-trained model paths to collaboratively train NS-GAN with the ground truth.  
python ST-train.py
